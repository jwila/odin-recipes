    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            You'll find the full recipe with all the ingredients and measurements, below, but making a Long Island Iced Tea couldn't be easier. 
            Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add all the various alcohols plus the sweet and sour mix. Hold aside the cola for now. Cover the cocktail shaker and give it a good shake to let all the spirits mix and chill. The Long Island Iced Tea is typically served in a Collins glass or a hurricane glass over a lot of fresh ice with a big splash of cola poured over the top, which creates that tea-like color. Add a slice of fresh lemon for garnish (and to give it that innocent iced tea look) and enjoy responsibly.
